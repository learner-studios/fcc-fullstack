This is some thoughts that I had with my reasons and studying,  I really like math a lot but not enough to stay committed to it.  What's more is I can' think of any goals or reasons that I want to do to keep the journey going. I can make it about personal growth and development but it can't be anything involving things like publishing a paper, but I will say this though I'm appreciative of the things I'm learning about problem solving.  I'm not terribly good at math, but it's something that I can steadily work on to get better with.  

The thought of doing the Launch School is good but for the moment I can't afford the monthly fee, but I see it as something that I can work towards, they have a dedicated mentor and community to help with answering questions and offering support.  There's just way too many things that are pulling me and my source of income.  And although I'm not too worried since more time is going by with settling into this job.  I am still scared to loose it, goes back to past experiences, it's also a little bit of disbelief that I got this and have come this far.  I think I started this play a little not serious about things, but now I want this place to last and mean someting.  Anyway I'm done for now...
